# CrossEngine

Hi everyone,

During the last few weeks I've been trying to make my previous engine (link here) run on Android platforms. However, I found out it is quite hard using the official documentation because it's quite ambiguous on some steps.

Now that it's actually working I'll leave you with a guide for you to clone this repo, install some libraries, and hit run.

GOOD LUCK!
